- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Unify is my name. Some may refer to me as UnifyTweaks, but it doesn't matter. I'd describe myself as an experienced PC tweaker / PC enthusiast whom aims for high performance while maintaining low latency (low input lag) and stable / high frame rates ( FPS )
- I'm definitely not your typical Twitter tweaker who runs a few registry files and calls it a day. I strive to be the best at what I do and take pride in it, but it's always beneficial to have that attitude.
- I will be posting alot of useful information / guides / tweaks in this blog and alot of videos, tutorials, and Q?A's on PC Tweaking / PC Help IN General pimps.
